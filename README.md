CSProfs (Computer Science Professors)
AJobs (Academic Jobs)

# Overview
CSProfs is a dataset of over 4000 CS professors from top US/Canada Universities.
AJobs is a collection of data on academic job openings in various universities in  USA for outgoing PhD students.

# Drafty UI
Drafty UI looks like spreadsheet/excel where each row corresponds to a CS Prof or a academic job opening.
 
# Data collections
Citizen user-editors contribute towards collection of data.
If multiple user-editors contribute suggestion to particular row, 
it means we have lots of data suggestions for particular cell. 

We resolve conflicting suggestions with our
algorithm, that tries to compute the most accurate suggestion among all the 
suggestions available.
