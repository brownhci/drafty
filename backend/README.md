# Drafty Backend

## How to Use

Steps:

1. Start your mysql server
   ```bash
   mysql.server start
   ```
1. If you need to import any existing MySQL database:
   ```bash
   mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < [path_to_.sql file]
   ```
   For example, `mysql -uroot -p test < src/database/profs.sql` will import the professors' database.

   - username need to have correct permissions, consider using root user if you are not sure
   - database_name should be an existing database
   - remember to give the user specified in `.env` proper privileges to the databases you imported.<br/>
     For example, the following MySQL statement is executed within MySQL prompt to give *testuser* privileges to *profs* database<br/>
     `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON profs.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';`
1. Create a MySQL (MariaDB) with user, permission, database correctly set up. Here is one of the various tutorials on how to [Create a MySQL user and assign access rights](https://gridscale.io/en/community/tutorials/create-a-mysql-user/).<br/>
   Steps including: *Don't foget to reflect your databases, users, passwords in .env file*:
   - create a database, user with correct privileges, password for main database<br/>
     [Create MySQL Database, Table & User From Command Line Guide](https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/mysql/managing-mysql-databases-and-users-from-the-command-line)
   - create another database, user with proper privileges, password for session database (*okay to reuse previous database, user, password*)<br/>
1. Create an environment file in `./backend/` directory, you can copy over `./backend/.env.example` for quick start
1. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies
1. Run `npm run build` to fully build the directory
1. Depends on whether you need continuous build (detects your changes and updates build), usually you want this for development, run one of the following script
    - run with `npm run watch` for continuous build
    - run with `npm start` for normal build


## Directory Structure

+ `.vscode/` Contains VS Code specific settings
+ `dist/` Contains the distributable (or output) from build (typescript, sass, handlebars...). This is the code actually deployed.
+ `node_modules/` Contains all npm dependencies
+ **`src/`** Contains source code that will be compiled to the dist dir
    + `config/` Passport authentication strategies, login middleware, handlebars helpers and render function helper (**use makeRenderObject(renderObject, request)** to include user information and sheet information necessary for navbar rendering**).
    + **`controllers/`** Controllers define functions that respond to various http requests
    + **`database/`** Define MySQL connection (`mysql.ts`); SQL statements and common operations (for example, `user.ts` contains function to add user, update user)
    + **`models/`** Define table and column name strings (**modify the corresponding model file after changing database schema**) and util functions that do not involve querying the database
    + **`public/`** Static assets that will be used client side
        + **`css/`** Page-wide and app-wide stylesheets (Sass is used and directory structure follows [7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) )<br/>
          To add new partials (*think it as modules to be imported*), put a new partial under correct directory and import it in the file with the same name as the directory
            + `abstracts/` The `abstracts/` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.
            + `base/` The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find the reset file, some typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements
            + **`components/`** For smaller components, there is the `components/` folder. While `layout/` is macro (defining the global wireframe), `components/` is more focused on widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
            + `layout/` The layout/ folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebarâ€¦), the grid system or even CSS styles for all the forms.
            + **`pages/`** page-specific styles. Each file should be named after the page.
            + `themes/` Different themes. Not currently used.
            + `vendors/` A folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks
        + `fonts/` Display required fonts
        + `images/` Display required images and icons
        + **`js/`** Client-side scripts
        + `webfonts/` FontAwesome required fonts
    + `types/` Holds .d.ts files not found on DefinitelyTyped.
    + **`util/`** Wrappers for third party libraries (for example, password authentifcation using bcrypt)
    + `validation/` Custom vaidation middleware, see [Custom validators/sanitizers](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/custom-validators-sanitizers.html
    + `src/server.ts` Entry point to your express app
    + **`src/app.ts`** Register all routes and corresponding controllers, import all third party libraries used for entire app.
+ `test/` Contains tests
+ **`views/`** Views define how the website renders on the client.
    + `account/` Views for account related pages (user sign in / sign out...)
    + `layouts/` Basic layout for all pages
    + `partial/` Reusable components
    + `sheets/` Views for individual sheets
    + `*.hbs` Views for other pages
+ **`.env.example`** Example configuration of database config, email config. Make sure to use a different `.env` file for production. **Do not commit actual `.env` file as it contains important secrets**.
+ `.eslintignore` Config settings for paths to exclude from linting
+ `.eslintrc` Config settings for ESLint code style checking
+ `.gitignore` Files and directories to be excluded from git commits
+ `.travis.yml` Used to configure Travis CI build
+ **`README.md`** Detailed information about this project. **Please update README when you introduce new functionalities or new directories**
+ `.copyStaticAssets.ts` Build script that copies images, fonts, and JS libs to the dist folder
+ `debug.log` A log of all error, warnings during running the application, a useful script to see the end of logs is `tail debug.log`
+ `jest.config.js` Used to configure Jest running tests written in TypeScript
+ `package.json` File that contains npm dependencies as well as build scripts
+ `tsconfig.json` Config settings for compiling server code written in TypeScript



## Troubleshooting

-  `[Node] (node:36476) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client`<br/>
   [Reason & Fix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50093144/mysql-8-0-client-does-not-support-authentication-protocol-requested-by-server)
- `SASS` install node-sass globally: npm install -g node-sass
- Missing directory, page not displayed properly<br/>
  Try run `npm run build` to fully rebuild the directory
